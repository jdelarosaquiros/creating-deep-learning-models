# Creating and Training Deep Learning Models

The goal of this project was to practice the basics of using Tensorflow and Keras by creating and training deep learning models: one for Computer Vision and another one for Natural Language Processing. The first step to create all models was to normalize the data, and the next two steps were to create the models and train them. The last step was to evaluate the models, but if the model undertrained or overtrained, it had to be modified respectively and trained again.
